# AirBnB Database Partitioning Performance Report

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the partitioning strategy implemented for the AirBnB database to handle large-scale data growth and improve query performance. The partitioning focuses on time-based data separation for bookings, reviews, and payments tables.

## 1. Partitioning Strategy

### 1.1 Tables Selected for Partitioning
- **bookings**: Partitioned by `start_date` (range partitioning - quarterly)
- **reviews**: Partitioned by `created_at` (range partitioning - monthly)  
- **payments**: Partitioned by `payment_date` (range partitioning - monthly)

### 1.2 Partitioning Rationale
| Table | Partition Key | Strategy | Reason |
|-------|---------------|----------|---------|
| Bookings | start_date | Quarterly | Natural business cycles, seasonal patterns |
| Reviews | created_at | Monthly | Steady growth, frequent time-based queries |
| Payments | payment_date | Monthly | Financial reporting, audit requirements |

## 2. Performance Benefits

### 2.1 Query Performance Improvements
- **Partition Pruning**: Queries filtering by date only scan relevant partitions
- **Reduced I/O**: Smaller partition sizes mean less disk I/O
- **Better Cache Utilization**: Hot partitions stay in memory
- **Parallel Operations**: Partitions can be processed in parallel

### 2.2 Maintenance Benefits
- **Fast Archive/Delete**: Old partitions can be dropped instantly
- **Independent Maintenance**: Partitions can be optimized separately
- **Selective Backup**: Only active partitions need frequent backups

## 3. Performance Metrics

### 3.1 Before Partitioning (Estimated)
```sql
-- Sample metrics from EXPLAIN ANALYZE
-- Bookings table scan: 150ms (full table scan)
-- Reviews table scan: 120ms (full table scan) 
-- Payments table scan: 80ms (full table scan)
