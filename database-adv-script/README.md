# SQL Joins Queries

This project demonstrates the use of different types of SQL joins on an Airbnb-like database.

- **INNER JOIN** → Retrieves all bookings with the users who made them.
- **LEFT JOIN** → Retrieves all properties with their reviews, including those with no reviews.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** → Retrieves all users and all bookings, even if a user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.
